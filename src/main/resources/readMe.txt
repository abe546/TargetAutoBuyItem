IMPORTANT : This programs assumes you only have 1 item in your cart.
If you have more than 1 item in your cart it will fail. So make sure your cart is empty, or whats in the cart
is just 1 item that may be added to. NO MORE THAN 1 ITEM IN CART

HOW TO USE :

Prerequisites :

You will need an already existing target account, with a default credit card selected.

NOT PAYPAL

You will need to provie your credit card CVV (3 digit security code) in the form of an environment variable.

You can do this using the IntelliJ IDE : https://www.jetbrains.com/help/objc/add-environment-variables-and-program-arguments.html
Simply do a CTRL + F in your browser to find in page: "Add environment variablesï»¿"

OR you could, less securely, simply enter your CVV as plain text on line 8 in file TargetAutoBuyItem\src\main\java\util\UserCredentials.java
e.g. public static final String TARGET_CC_CVV_SECRET = "123"; //Don't use 123 user your actual CVV code

By default the URL the program is set to open is : https://www.target.com/p/dualsense-wireless-controller-for-playstation-5/-/A-81114477

You can change this by inputting your OWN URL on line 28 of file TargetAutoBuyItem\src\main\java\Application.java
e.g. driver = openWebPage.openPage("https://google.com");

Now, in order to use this you will need to click start, and you will be given a 60 second time window to login to
your Target account (YOU HAVE TO DO THIS MANUALLY)

IMPORTANT : This programs assumes you only have 1 item in your cart.
If you have more than 1 item in your cart it will fail. So make sure your cart is empty, or whats in the cart
is just 1 item that may be added to. NO MORE THAN 1 ITEM IN CART

After logging in successfully you should be redirected back to the item page, now take your hands off the keyboard and wait.

You've given permission to a computer program to use your credit card to purchase the maximum amount of items
that is available at your local target store (if youre local pick up store isn't in stock it won't execute).

P.S If someone stole this and sold it you, you got schemed, and more importantly I want my cut of the money.
